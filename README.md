First attempt at Blazor

This application is addressing the need of a daycare center. It aims to achieve the following goals:
1. Provide parents with a way to see how their child is doing during the day at any point in time. 
1. Provide daycare teachers with a simple and intuitive and a quick way to add various events about kids that happen during the day (nap, food, diaper changes, activities)
1. Provide daycare staff with a way to manage teachers and rooms.
1. Provide a way for daycare staff to communicate with parents about their child's needs (diapers, wipes, pajama Friday)
